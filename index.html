  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" target="_blank" title="World_War_II">Following World War2,(第2次世界大戦)</a> <br>oceanographers equipped with new marine tools and ample funding form the U.S. Office of Naval Reasearch embarked on an unprecedented period of oceanographic exploration. Over the next two decades, a much better picture of large expanses of the seafloor slowly and painstakingly began to emerge. From this work canme the discovery of a global<strong> oceanic <u>ridge</u> system</strong> that winds through all the major oceans in a manner similar to the   seams on a baseball.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:40px;">In other parts of the ocean, more new discoveries were being made. Studies conducted in the western Pacific demonstrated that earthquakes were occurring at great depths beneath deep-ocean trenches. Of equal importance was the fact that dredging of the seafloor did not bring up any oceanic crust that was older than 180 million years. Further, sediment accumulations in the deep-ocean basins were found to be thin, not the thousands of meters that were predicted. By 1968   thses developments, among others, had led to the unfolding of a far more encompassing theory than continetal drift, known as the <strong>theory of plate tectonics</strong> (<em>tekto</em>=to build).</p>
